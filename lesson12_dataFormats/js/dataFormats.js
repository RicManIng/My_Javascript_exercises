/* 
    the two data formats more used in JavaScript are JSON and XML

    JSON: JavaScript Object Notation
    XML: Extensible Markup Language

    JSON is more popular than XML because it is more lightweight and easier to read and write

    for security reasons XML is more preferable than JSON

    use JSON for exange data more quickly
    use XML for exange data more securely

    JSON example:
    {
        "name": "John",
        "age": 30,
        "city": "New York"
    }
    
    or 

    {
        "person": {
            "name": "John",
            "age": 30,
            "city": "New York"
        }
    }

    XML example:
    <person>
        <name>John</name>
        <age>30</age>
        <city>New York</city>
    </person>
